Range function: 
1. Range function is used for providing limits for the execution of for loop 

Syntax: 

     range(starting limit,endinglimit+-1 , updation) 

Note: 
1. Default value of updation is 1 
2. If we provide only one value for range it will consider it as a ending limits and stats from 0 


For loop in the range: 
1. For loop with the range is used whenever we wants to perform some operation based on number limits. 

Syntax: 

     for variable in range(sl,el+-1,updt): 
          statements of for loop 

Example: 
print number between the range of 1 to 10
        
      For I in range(1,10,1): 
          print(I)
